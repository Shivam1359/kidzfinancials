//             <p>RESPs are to education what RRSPs are for retirement. 
//                 They let you put money aside for your child’s post-secondary education. 
//                 In this way, you give your child the greatest gift: an opportunity to achieve a dream career.  
//                 The money that accumulates in an RESP can be used to cover tuition fees and all the other financial outlays that come with higher education, 
//                 such as lodging, school supplies, food and transportation. </p>

//                 <br></br>

//             <h2>Who can open an RESP?</h2>
//             <p>Parents, grandparents, godparents, uncles, aunts and friends... anyone can open an RESP for a child, and a child can be the beneficiary of multiple RESPs.
//                  If a number of you are contributing money for a single child, 
//                  you’ll need to make sure you stay within the governmental contribution limits to avoid any tax penalties, 
//                  since the maximum contributions are determined per child.</p>

//                  <br></br>
            
//             <h2>Who can be named as the beneficiary of an RESP?</h2>
//             <p>You can designate any child you wish and you don’t have to be related to that child. 
//                 You also have the option to change beneficiaries once the plan is in force. 
//                 Contributions can then continue to be made up to the end of the plan term determined according to the age of the new beneficiary.</p>

//                  <br></br>

//             <h2>How much money can you save?</h2>
//             <p>The <strong>maximum contribution per child</strong> is set at <strong>$5,000 per child </strong>and maximum lifetime contribution is set at $50,000 per child and there are no annual contribution limits. 
//                 This means you can tailor your contributions as your budget allows, provided you stay within the lifetime maximum permitted per child.</p>
